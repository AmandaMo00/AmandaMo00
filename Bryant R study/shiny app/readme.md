# The purpose 
is to simplify the comparing of multiple models' performance
### Processes  explanation
1. There is an input where users could upload the data
2. Three kinds of graph can be generated: scatter, density, and barplot by selected variables.
3. Three models are implemented : regression tree, random forest, and K-means cluster
4. Each model have been set 3 hyperparameters for tunning
5. Users could choose 1,2,3 models to run at the same time
6. Running out the accuracy results for comparison


## app_tab_layout (2).R is the file that runs.
