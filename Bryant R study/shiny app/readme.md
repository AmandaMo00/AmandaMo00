# The purpose 
is to simplify the comparing of multiple models' performance
### Processes  explanation
1. There is an input where users could upload the data
2. Three models are implemented : regression tree, random forest, and K-means cluster
3. Each model have been set 3 hyperparameters for tunning
4. Users could choose 1,2,3 models to run at the same time
5. Running out the accuracy results for comparison
